# RoboRunner Xeon 

Welcome to the repository for _RoboRunner Xeon_, a platformer game heavily inspired by the Megaman X series.

This is my first attempt at creating a platformer game. My name is Nick, the (currently sole) developer of this project. I'm using RoboRunner as an opportunity to learn and test my understanding of platformer games and how to create them (hopefully in a proper manner) in Unity.
### About my work on this project
I'm doing some hybrid work with chatGPT, which I'm relying on for menial tasks and smaller code snippets, along with some debugging. I think it's important to get familiar with this emerging technology and find ways to get the best results out of AI. I'm also regularly consulting Melvyn May's [2D physics examples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/PhysicsExamples2D), to learn Unity's different 2D-physics features along with optimized and well-structured code that best makes use of it. The rest of the code and its implementation is common sense I've learned from CS studies in CEGEP. I've never worked with C# before using Unity, but it's similar enough to Java that it doesn't feel entirely foreign to me.

## My inspiration

I loved the Megaman X series as a child and the show-don't-tell philosophy of teaching players how to play the game that it adopted. I endeavor to create something as fun and intuitive with this project.
